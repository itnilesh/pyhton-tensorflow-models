# pyhton-tensorflow-models
Simple machine learning models using tensorflow 1.10.0

We will do basic ML flow while developing model

1. Prepare training data and test data
2. Create predict function 
3. Train model 
4. Save check-points of mode
5. Do inference/predict on trained model
6. Export model in saved model format so that we use it in Tensorflow serving and offer as docker container.

Also we can visualize data using matlibplot
